Some basic python practice implementing neat numerical algorithms, etc.

includes: \
-Extended Euclidean Algorigthm for solving gcd(a, b) and Bezout Identity: gcd(a,b)=ax+by \
-Pollard-Rho integer factorization \
-Collatz Conjecture (3x+1) tool: given positive integer x, how long does it take to reach 1 by following the rules of the
  conjecture
